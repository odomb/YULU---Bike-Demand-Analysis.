# YULU---Bike-Demand-Analysis.
"Investigating factors affecting shared electric cycle demand in India using EDA and Hypothesis Testing to drive revenue recovery."


A. Business Case & Purpose :

Project Title: Yulu: Shared Electric Cycle Demand Analysis

Description: This project analyzes the demand patterns for Yulu, India’s leading micro-mobility provider. Following recent revenue dips, this study identifies significant variables—such as weather conditions, seasonal shifts, and working day schedules—that predict bike rental volume. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations for fleet optimization and targeted marketing.

B. Project Scope & Methodology:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering trends and patterns across continuous variables (temp, humidity) and categorical variables (seasons, weather).

Hypothesis Testing: Using statistical rigor to validate business assumptions.

2-Sample T-Test: Determining if Working Day impacts the average rental count.

ANOVA: Testing if demand varies significantly across different Seasons and Weather types.

Chi-Square Test: Evaluating the dependency between Weather and Season. 

C. Tech Stack :

Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas (Data Manipulation), Seaborn/Matplotlib (Visualization), Scipy.stats (Statistical Testing).
